# ArogyaAI: AI-Powered Vaccine Management Platform

ArogyaAI is an end-to-end platform that leverages artificial intelligence to help healthcare providers manage vaccine distribution, predict demand, identify dropout risks, and detect zero-dose clusters. The system consists of a modern React frontend and a FastAPI backend with integrated machine learning models and data files.

## üöÄ Main Features
- **Vaccine Demand Forecasting:** Predict short-term vaccine demand per district using LSTM models and climate data.
- **Dropout Risk Prediction:** Identify children at risk of missing vaccinations for early intervention.
- **Zero-Dose Cluster Detection:** Detect and prioritize high-risk areas for targeted vaccination efforts.
- **Beautiful, Responsive UI:** Modern, mobile-friendly interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Interactive API Docs:** Explore and test APIs via FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI.

         |<----------->  ML Models, Data, etc. <--------|
```
- **Frontend:** User interface for data entry, visualization, and results.
- **Backend:** FastAPI server hosting ML models and API endpoints.
- **ML Models:** LSTM, XGBoost, KMeans, etc. for predictions and clustering.
- **Data:** CSVs and pickled models for predictions and analytics.

# üß† Backend (FastAPI + ML)

## Features
- FastAPI server with modular routers
- ML models for forecasting, dropout, and clustering
- Pretrained models and data files included
- Interactive API docs at `/docs`

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Docker (optional)

## Setup & Scripts
```bash
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install dependencies
uvicorn main:app --reload         # Start API server (http://localhost:8000)
# Docker alternative:
docker build -t arogyaai-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 arogyaai-backend
```

## Folder Structure
```
Backend/
  main.py            # FastAPI app entry point
  routers/           # API route modules (forecasting, dropout, cluster)
  cluster_model/     # Pretrained clustering models (pkl)
  notebooks/         # Model training and analysis notebooks
  data/              # Datasets (CSV)
  requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
  ...
```

## Data & Models
- **/data/**: Contains CSVs for dropout prediction, demand forecasting, and clustering.
  - `dropout_prediction_satara.csv`: Data for dropout risk model
  - `vaccine_demand_forecasting.csv`: Data for demand forecasting
  - `zero_dose_clusters_maharashtra.csv`: Data for cluster detection
- **/cluster_model/**, **/notebooks/models/**, **/notebooks/vaccine_models/**: Pretrained ML models (KMeans, LSTM, etc.) in `.pkl` or `.h5` format
- **How it works:**
  - Models are loaded at API startup and used for predictions on incoming requests.
  - Data files are used for retraining, validation, and analytics.

## API Endpoints
- **/api/forecast/predict**  
  Predict vaccine demand (POST)
- **/api/dropout/predict**  
  Predict dropout risk (POST)
- **/api/cluster/predict**  
  Detect zero-dose clusters (POST)

See [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for full API documentation and interactive testing.
